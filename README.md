# Betfair-Sportsbook-Scraper
Scraper for my own personal use, made for scraping "www.betfair.es" for soccer matches. I don't particularly think the code is pretty - but hey, it works.

I'm not uploading the  part of the code regarding analysis of the scraped data, though. It can and will find strategies to make money, and whilst I don't have the money or the capability to act on it now (which wouldn't be viable anyway in Spain due to the DGOJ and Betfair's policy of banning winners, but that's another matter)... I won't release to the public so they can profit from my work. If you're interested in that, you already have access to the scraping part - do your own analysis.
